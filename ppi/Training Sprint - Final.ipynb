    "# Welcome to the PPI project! \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Training Sprint is to get everyone acquainted and comfortable with the tools and concepts that we will be using to work on this project. In this notebook, we will be going over some of the general terms, concepts, and software we will be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software and Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Rosetta, ROSIE, and PyMol.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Rosetta?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rosetta is a large macromolecular software suite developed by the Baker lab at the University of Washington. It includes a variety of algorithms tailored to the computational modeling, analysis, design, and prediction of protein structures. You can read more about Rosetta [here](https://new.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/Home). You are encouraged to browse the website and take a look at descriptions for different algorithms/functions to get a better sense of how and why Rosetta is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is ROSIE?\n",
    "\n",
    "[ROSIE](https://rosie.graylab.jhu.edu/) stands for the Rosetta Online Server that Includes Everyone. It is a web interface for some (not all) Rosetta functions. Anyone can submit a job for a particular algorithm. The results are computed and returned to the user once the task is completed. This can be useful for us to submit easy jobs or double-check some of our work. The results also include a lot of additional visualizations, which are useful for us to analyze. A major con of using ROSIE, however, is that we never know how long it will take for us to get our results. It is also susceptible to random errors and only certain protocols are available, so we can't rely on it over the course of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is PyMOL?\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyMOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyMOL) is a molecular visualization software. It allows us to take a closer look at the structures of specific proteins/PPIs, and we can use it to compare changes in the structures following any modifications we make."
