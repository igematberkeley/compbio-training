training ideas:
- have jupyter notebooks already going over the programs
- considering transitioning so that they can work with better documentation
- less coding focused, more conceptual to understand the project while they determine how to transition
- could be more lit review focused to understand goals
- could add some basics on simulations

outline for training:
- train on parts they want to keep from before that are well documented already exiting in the notebooks (currently on drive)
- more lit review/conceptual focused for the part they decide to revamp in their pipeline
- try to tie it back to wetlab (ex: the protiens are the same)
