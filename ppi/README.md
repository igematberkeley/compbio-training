training ideas:
- have jupyter notebooks already going over the programs
- considering transitioning so that they can work with better documentation
- less coding focused, more conceptual to understand the project while they determine how to transition
- could be more lit review focused to understand goals

outline for training:
- train on parts they want to keep from before that are well documented already exiting in the notebooks
- more lit review/conceptual focused for the part they decide to revamp in their pipeline
