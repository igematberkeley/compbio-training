outline for training:

* Exploring setup and onboarding:
 * New Github, old github
 * making a savio login
 * pip and making their own environment!
 * ChemAxon license
 
HOW are we going to organize and where code, workspace/flow will go.  

* Primary goal: make sure new and old members know the ins and outs of all aspects of the project
  * Reading papers
  * How to use cheminformatics software
  * Annotating paper (manual, and automatic!)
  * Fetch the paper using an API
  * 
  
 * Secondary objective: Connecting project to wetlab component
  * Wetlab is engineering better promoter-terminator pairs (regulatory units that control a gene)
  * Output: colorimetric observation of the gene that is involved in production of carotene
  * Using our tools to probe this reaction of interest, find reaction data from papers! 
  * Explore potential alternative byproducts w/ reaction operators 
  * Standalone component that's all in Java. Could be a bit annoying for us, but would helpf a lot with streamlining future members training and setup. 
  * Use RDKit, stick to a few logical operators, and produce the resultant products!
