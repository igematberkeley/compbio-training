* Primary
*   depends on level of student: technical side of each of those softwares:
*   if no CS experience: be able to know how to use them in the context of project

* what tools are we using:
  * trRosetta
    * there's a folder of all the papers: all the systems and algorithms
    * "guided through how to use each of these algorithms"
    * there's a presentation that we could link to, 
    * software usage, vs CLI-tool usage
    * mechanics of "how to execute"
    * testing different proteins "and seeing how the tools work"
      *  how to query experimental structures, compare to our models and get RMSE?
      *  error-graph produced with every run -- error per residue, global error graph
    * then model a specific protein.
      * the old protein one active site, usefulness of engineering a better mutant of TEM-1-Beta-lactamase would be not as worthwhile
      * could be easy to test in wetlab
      *     
  * AlphaFold + RosettaFold ab initio
  * this was on CoLab; trRosetta was on Savio
